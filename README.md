For this project, I decided to build a game called 'Guess The Phrase' (working title). 

Below is a short step by step guide to how the game will work.

1 - Enter a username & press 'LET'S GO' button <br>
2 - Q1 appears on next page as an image <br>
3 - User wnters answer in text input box and pressed 'GUESS' button <br>

4 - If answer is correct:

            - Add 50 points to user's score
            - Navigate to next question
            
If answer is incorrect:

            - Take off 1 life
            - Print wrong answer above text input box
            
5 - If user presses 'PASS' button instead, navigate to next question <br>
6 - When all questions have been answered / passed on or user runs out of lives navigate to game-over page

            - Display user's final score
            - Print a list of all users' scores in table form
